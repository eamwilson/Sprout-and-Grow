            <p>
                Sprout & Grow began with a simple belief: that healthy gardens grow from healthy roots — in the soil, in the community, and in the way we care for our environment. What started as a small passion project in a backyard greenhouse has blossomed into Raleigh's trusted source for organic, sustainable gardening.<br> <br>            
                Founded by plant lovers with a deep respect for nature and a desire to do things differently, Sprout & Grow was built on a foundation of transparency, integrity, and a commitment to environmental stewardship. We saw a need for a nursery that not only offered beautiful, high-quality plants but also served as a guide and ally for gardeners seeking to tread lightly on the earth. <br> </p> </section>

                <p> Every plant we nurture, every piece of advice we share, and every workshop we host is grounded in our mission: to empower our community with the tools and knowledge to grow sustainably — and joyfully.
